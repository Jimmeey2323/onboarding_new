                <p>The class begins with a warm up and sequence of upper-body exercises which includes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Free weights</li>
                    <li>Push-ups</li>
                    <li>Plank positions</li>
                    <li>Specific exercises that target the bicep, tricep, shoulder, chest and back muscles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Core muscles are engaged through over 80% of the 57 minutes, and the abdominal wall is also strengthened through a series of “C-Curve” exercises.</p>
                <p>Thighs and glutes compose the longest sequences of class, ensuring a thorough workout of the largest muscle groups in the body, thereby resulting in maximum caloric burn and cardio intensity which in turn helps with resetting one’s metabolism to work faster at rest.</p>
                <p>Our movements are used to tone muscles which are then fully stretched after each set of exercises. Instructors offer personalised attention to perfect posture and body alignment and encourage clients to work at their optimal level. Lively and fun music helps clients stay focused and work even harder.</p>

                <p>If you attend Physique 57 classes 3-4 times per week and maintain a healthy diet then yes, you will become slimmer. Our system of exercises focuses on strengthening and lengthening the muscles.</p>
                <p>The more muscle one has in proportion to fat, the more calories one will burn throughout the day, even at rest. Remember, muscle tissue burns about 15 times as many calories as fat, even when you’re not exercising!</p>
                <p>Exercise will help you accomplish more than just weight loss. Exercise has been proven to reduce:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Heart disease</li>

                <p>To see significant results, we recommend that clients take class 3-4 times a week. Beginners are encouraged to take class often to gain a better understanding of the positions to build muscle memory and efficiency.</p>
                <p>Clients experiencing soreness are also encouraged to attend class often, even on consecutive days. Muscle soreness and stiffness usually happens to people who are just beginning an exercise program or to those who work the same set of muscles in a new and different way.</p>
                <p>Because of the large variety of strength and stamina building variations at Physique 57, clients are apt to feel some muscle soreness after every class. Sore muscles will have ample opportunity to be stretched and relaxed during class because of the method’s emphasis on musculoskeletal and rehabilitative stretching.</p>

                <p>This sequencing helps build muscle efficiently and strengthens the heart muscle. Overall, interval training leads to improved performance particularly within the cardiovascular system.

                    <li>Decreased risk of injury</li>

                <p>The philosophy to avoid machines is important, because machines are designed to help us with our movement. By taking away the assistance that machines provide, we increase our strength rapidly.</p>

                <p>Research shows that Indians face decreased bone density compared to other global populations due to a number of lifestyle factors including diet, sunlight exposure and genetic factors.</p>
                <p>To counteract this predisposition, low-impact workouts that incorporate strength training including weight-bearing exercises are critical. Strength and Resistance Training are an integral part of the Physique 57 method which aids in building bone density.</p>
                <br><p>Our exercises are low impact and the exercise sequences are crafted in a way that puts the correct amount of strain on bones thus recruiting bone building mechanisms. After the age of 35, our bone density decreases by less than a percent every year. While we don't claim to treat conditions like osteoporosis and osteopenia, we definitely slow the progression via our safe and sustainable movement methodology.</p>

                <p>Physique 57 does not include traditional sit ups because they do not work the correct abdominal muscles.

                <p>During menopause, estrogen levels fluctuate severely in the body. With high estrogen levels, your body is likely to store more fat while low estrogen impacts metabolism. As a result of this it is very common for women to gain weight (especially around the belly) during menopause.</p>
                <p>Research also shows that muscle cells reduce with a decline in estrogen thereby also reducing bone strength (particularly hips, spine and arms). Low estrogen also increases risk of more lifestyle diseases such as Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>The Physique 57 method combines isometric with isotonic movement choreographed to be different sequences and moves in each class, which leads to a healthy amount of muscle confusion. This muscle confusion and versatility in low-impact movement helps ensure women sculpt muscle when they most need it.</p>

                <p>The benefits of group exercise have been proven time and again, partly explained by what we know as the Kohler Effect. According to this phenomenon, performance is enhanced for tasks attempted in a group setting due to our inherent inclination toward competition. In other words, no one wants to be the weakest link in a group.</p>
                <p>As a result, group workouts tend to bring out optimised performance in individuals - combined with the motivation, support and endorphin rush people might experience by being surrounded by others attempting the same tasks.</p>
                <p>Our instructors at Physique 57 have been trained extensively to provide a personalised workout experience within a group class setting, and have been trained to provide personalised modifications as required, while maintaining the energy a group class needs, thereby ensuring that clients feel safe and supported.</p>
