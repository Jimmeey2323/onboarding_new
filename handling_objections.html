            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">An <strong>objection</strong> in sales is a reason or concern raised by a potential customer that prevents them from committing to a purchase or decision. It’s a natural part of the sales process and often arises from doubts, misunderstandings, or fear of making the wrong decision. Objections can appear at any stage of the sales journey and need to be handled effectively to keep the conversation moving forward.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Handling objections is a key skill for any salesperson. It’s important to recognize that objections provide opportunities to uncover needs and offer solutions, rather than seeing them as obstacles. The way you respond can greatly influence the outcome of the conversation.</p>

Plus, you don’t need to spend hours at the gym to see results. We also offer flexible class schedules, and you can easily book a session that fits into your day—whether it’s before work, during lunch, or after work. If even that doesn’t work, we offer virtual classes, so you can take part from the comfort of your own home. We’ve had many members who manage to squeeze in a quick workout, and they say it’s the best part of their day. How does that sound to you?”</p>
